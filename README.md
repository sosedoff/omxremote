# omxremote

Web interface and API for Raspberry Pi Omxplayer.

## Overview

[Omxplayer](http://elinux.org/Omxplayer) is made specifically for Raspberry Pi (RPi) and
is one of the most simpliest video players you can find. Although there are many others,
including [raspbmc](http://www.raspbmc.com/) that work as a full-blown media center,
omxplayer is a perfect fit for systems that do not have any GUI or peripherals and running stock 
[Rasbpian](http://www.raspbian.org/) OS. However, omxplayer was designed to be
controlled via keyboard shortcuts and does not provide any way to control it remotely.

Omxremote project is an attempt to build a web frontend and simple API to control 
video playback on a remote RPi device. Its built in Go, which has capability to 
cross-compile source code for ARM and as a result provides a single binary with 
no external dependencies to be downloaded and installed on your Pi.

## Requirements

In order to use `omxremote` you must have `omxplayer` installed on your RPi. Most
recent distributions on Rasbpian should already come with `omxplayer` preinstalled.

In case if you dont have it installed, use the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y omxplayer
```

No special permissions are required in order to play videos with `omxplayer` and `omxremote`.

## Install

Use [Github Releases](https://github.com/sosedoff/omxremote/releases)

Or run the following snippet for quick install:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sosedoff/omxremote/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Compile

Compiling this project on RPi is a bit of a difficult task and does not necessarily makes
sense since Go provides ability to cross-compile source code for multiple platforms on
your local development environment. You can do that by following the steps:

```
make setup
make release
```

That will produce a binary that's ready to be transferred and executed on your RPi. 
In cases if you don't have Make available on your system, you can execute the following commands:

```
go get
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build
```

## Usage

Options:

```
Usage of omxremote:
  -frontend
      Enable frontend applicaiton (default true)
  -media string
      Path to media files (default "./")
  -v  Print version
  -zeroconf
      Enable service advertisement with Zeroconf (default true)
```

To start omxremote, run the following command:

```
omxremote -media /path/to/media
```

By default server will start on port 8080 and listen on all network interfaces. You can
connect to it if you have any device (laptop, phone) on the same wifi network.
If you dont know the IP address of your RPi, run `ifconfig`.

To enable service discovery using [Zeroconf](http://zeroconf.org/), use the flag:

```
omxremote -media ./ -zeroconf
```

Omxremote advertises itself as `omxremote._tcp`

To start the server on a specific interface or a given port, set the HOST and PORT variables.
```
HOST=192.168.1.100 PORT=8081 omxremote -media ./
```

### Running as daemon

First, make sure you have copied the binary to `/usr/bin/`:

```
sudo cp omxremote /usr/bin/
```

To test if omxremote could be found in $PATH, run:

```
which omxremote
# => /usr/bin/omxremote
```

Next step is to create a media directory:

```
mkdir /home/pi/media
```

This directory will be used by omxremote to scan for all media files. The following
section config files will also use that directory.

#### init.d

Use the following [example](https://github.com/sosedoff/omxremote/blob/master/config/omxremote.initd) to create a new init.d script:

```
sudo nano /etc/init.d/omxremote
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/omxremote
```

And then you can start the remote:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/omxremote start
```

#### systemd

Use the following [example](https://github.com/sosedoff/omxremote/blob/master/config/omxremote.service) to create a new unit file:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/omxremote.unit
sudo systemctl enable omxremote
sudo service omxremote start
```

### API

Endpoints:

- `/status`        - Returns current player status
- `/browse`        - Returns files in specified media directory
- `/play`          - Start media playback
- `/command/:name` - Execute a command
- `/host`          - Get host stats (memory, storage)
- `/remove`        - Remove a media file or directory

Available commands:

- `pause`
- `stop`
- `volume_up`
- `volume_down`
- `subtitles`
- `seek_back`
- `seek_back_fast`
- `seek_forward`
- `seek_forward_fast`
- `next_audiotrack`
- `prev_audiotrack`

### Troubleshooting

```
ERROR: COMXAudio::Decode timeout
```

If you see this error when playing video files, make sure to give more memory
to raspberry pi GPU. On B+ model the default is 16mb. Try setting it to 64/128mb.
To edit settings, run: `sudo raspi-config`.

#### Raspbian 8

Raspbian 8 does not carry `omxplayer` binary. You must install the player before
using omxremote:

```
sudo apt-get install -y omxplayer
```
